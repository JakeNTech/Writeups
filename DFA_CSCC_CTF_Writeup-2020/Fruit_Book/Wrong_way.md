`What app did the user "sneaky" try to install via a .dmg file?`

DMG files are files that tyipcally contain applications when you download them from the internet, and they don't requier an install (Which is really nice!) rather the user just copies it out of the "container" into an application folder.\ 
Looking through the files for the "sneaky" user there is only one DMG file, and its in the trash (Recycle bin)
`silenteye-0.4.1b-snowleopard.dmg` and the name of the app is `silent eye`\
