# A second listner (50)
`File shell.pcapng What is the port for the second shell?`

We need to go to `Statisctics -> Conversations`, and move to the TCP tab, there we see a fair few converstaions:

Port 80 is always used for HTTP traffic so I am not that interested in those right off the bat, but there is one conversation that lasted significantly longer then the others, we are looking at the TCP tab as thatâ€™s the protocol that a remote shell uses, we click on it and press follow stream.
We see it looks like an SSH session, and that the user was trying to pass `/etc/passwd` file onto a listner using port 9999, we can then view this and see the /etc/passwd file.
