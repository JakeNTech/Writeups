`File smb.pcapng There is a nice simple flag in the file that was accessed.`

Looking once again at `Statistics -> Conversations -> TCP` and one of the streams we can view seems to contain alot more than the others `bytes B -> A : 71k` so we follow this stream and scroll down and we can see the bee movie script, using the search at the bottom of the dialog box for `flag` gets us the answer.

This can also be sloved by exporting the SMB objects and opening the file in a text editor and searching for the flag.
