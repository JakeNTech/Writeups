# New phone who Dis (50)
`You get a phone call from this number: 855-707-7328, they were previously known by another name?`

We need to find out who this phone number belongs too, so we google it and it would seem that it belongs to a company called `Spectrum` but they want the name they used to be called, to Wikipedia and we see they where called Time Warner cable and Bright House Network.
