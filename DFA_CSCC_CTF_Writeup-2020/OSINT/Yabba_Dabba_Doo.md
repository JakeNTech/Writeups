`Can You Figure Out Which State This Picture Has Been Taken From? See attached photo Warning, you only have 3 attempts`

After having downloaded the image we can see that it has no EXIF information, so we need to run a google search on the image.
Google image search is immensely powerful! But unfortunately, the first few results donâ€™t get us any closer, as it helpfully tells us that we are looking at a statue! But it always pays to scroll down!

We find the image and it links us to a jameskanith.com site, titled `Virginia Adventures: Dinosaur land` , reading the blog post we get the answer.
