`What is the processor architecture of the system?`

The answer lies in the registry, again, but this time in the SYSTEM hive, `SYSTEM\CurrentControl001\Control\Session Manager\Enviroment` and there is alot of intresting information stored here but the one we are after is processor architecture, which like most modern systems, is `AMD64`
