`What is the logical size of the file "strawberry.jpg"? Answer in bytes.`

I know the location of this file from some earlier exploring: `F:\Users\suzy.strawberry\Pictures` and we right click on the image and hit 'view properties';
```
Size: 70.7KB (72,488 bytes)
Size on disk: 72.0KB (73,728 bytes)
```
Logical size is just size, so the flag is 72488
