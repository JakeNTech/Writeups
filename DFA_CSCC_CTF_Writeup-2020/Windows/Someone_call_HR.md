`What was the role of the employee Tim was flirting with?`

We know slack was installed on the machine so its possiable we could dig up somthing in there, but there is a much easier place to start, the internet history. I chose to start, once again, with firefox:
`F:\Users\tim.apple\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\d6kc02w6.default-release\places.sqlite`  looking at the `moz_places` table there are a number of searches refering to secretery, as always:
```
10 - Is it ok to flirt with my secretery - Google Search
18 - 20 Signs Your Secretery Is A Home Wrecker
16 - How to Flirt with a Woman at Work | The Modern Man
```
so this is the answer.
