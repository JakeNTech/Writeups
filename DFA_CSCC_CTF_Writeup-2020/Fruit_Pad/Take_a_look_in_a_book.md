# Take a look in a book (250)
`The user was reading a book in real life but used their Fruit Pad to record the page that they had left off on. What number was it?`

There are two logical places the answer might appear Notes or Reminders, but sometimes people take a picture of things so let's start with that:
`/private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE` shows a number of pictures, but there is a video; exporting the .MOV into windows and then playing it shows someone flicking through a book and then zooming into a page number, they "zoom" in on page 85, suggesting this is where they are. and it is indeed 85!
