# Find me (300) - UNSLOVED
`If you find me what should I buy?`

This could be stored anywhere, but while searching arround I found the `notes.sqlite` file, which on examiation contained some notes, and the file is convently structured like it is on OS X:
```
| ZSINIPPET            | ZTITLE1                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The clouds give rest | From time to time                                                  |
| Racing for the PS4   | Did you find me? Then you should Buy Crash Bandicoot Nitro-Fueledâ€¦ |
```
