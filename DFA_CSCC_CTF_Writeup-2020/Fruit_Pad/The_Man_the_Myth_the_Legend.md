`Who is using the iPad? Inclued their first and last name?`

I don't think that I got the answer from the best of places, but looking at the calander `private/var/mobile/Libary/Calendar/Calendar.sqlitedb` and one of the rows on the calandar table contains an email address `tim.apple@fruitinc.xyz`, so this is the user, there are other artifacts that point to the user of the device but when compleating this challange I hadn't found any more.
